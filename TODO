compress/encrypt: review API crypto->nsscrypto + compress->zlibcompress and ABI
                  current feels clumpsy and we can save memcpy around
                  in case we don't encrypt/compress

compress must happen before encrypt, should we compress all? what's
the price for uncompress on already uncompressed buffer? do we need
a bit to indicate if pckt is compressed or not?
is it worth compressing pings? do they compress at all?

config bits:
- should crypto and compress be part of handle_new? or new api calls?
  we won't allow runtime changes, so i don't think there is much
  benefit to have it outside of knet_handle_net for now.
  We maybe able to spare some duplication between knet_h and knet_cfg struct

link layer:

one we have pckt inspector in place, we need a function to:

int get_dst_links(knet_host *host, int *fd_array, size_t fd_array_size);

that will call into dst_cache

dst_cache is populated by link status changes, cache calculation should
probably be in its own thread. this is a bit touchy to implement, specially
due to rwlocks required to update the cache. Look into link status changes
notification (maybe a signal to a thread? or write to a pipe)

if all links for a host are down, then clear circular_buffers (this
is necessary to detect restarts and a bunch of other things)

* add priority/weight to link config struct
* add active/active to link config struct

ring:

* support 8 listener per node.
* index pointer list

general:

* what to log
  log to file: who logins, config changes and link status changes
  log to vty: cmd execution failure

* consider splitting tests/* based on what they test (tap_test -> libtap/) ?

vty:

* split cmd_files
* basic show info
* fix check_param for ip/prefix/crypto

libtap:

* add man pages
* improve tests to cover thread safety and more error codes

0.3
---

* benchmark tests:
  - all critical paths in ring.c

0.4
---

general:

* add statistics
* add init script / spec file
* v4/v6 (bindv6only check via cli)

vty:

* add optional options
* sorting
* tab completion on options

0.5

* pong count

0.6

* dynip

0.7
---

* review ring api for libknetring shared lib
* review tap api for libknettap shared lib
* review vty api for libknetvty shared lib

1.0-pre
-------

tests:

* coverity
* unit test:
  - test all public APIs
  - write ad-doc tests for internal complex functions
  - not required to test return codes from external libs directly
    (we are not testing glibc)
  - test all code paths we write
  - no 0.9/1.0 release without max testing coverage for the core
